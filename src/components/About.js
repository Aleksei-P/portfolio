        <h2>About</h2>
        <p>
          In the past, I was involved in the design and construction process of structures that varied widely in complexity. For this, I obtained a Masterâ€™s Degree in Civil &
          Industrial Building Engineering. A few years ago I moved locations, giving me the opportunity to switch career paths to a job at a company where I began studying web
          development. During my time there, I obtained the skills to work with web development tools and technologies. I enjoyed moving in this direction and would like to continue to be a member of an experienced team and improve my skills as a developer.
